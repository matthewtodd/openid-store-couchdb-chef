    # entirely complete, and there seems to be no word on the
    # progress[http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-199] of integrating it
    # into Chef proper. Also, it makes use of CouchDB features I don't yet
    # support in hideabed[http://github.com/matthewtodd/hideabed].
    #
    # Also note that OpenID is largely going
    # away[http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef-dev/2009-06/msg00001.html]
    # in Chef 0.8, so we really just need a stopgap measure.
